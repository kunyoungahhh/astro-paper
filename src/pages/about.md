Born in a small town, I was connected to the vast world through the wonders of fiber optics, sparking my belief in technology’s power to unite and empower. To me, software development is more than writing code—it’s about bridging gaps, improving accessibility, and giving others the opportunities I was fortunate to receive. Through thoughtful problem-solving and engineering, I strive to create solutions that connect and uplift, making the world a more inclusive place.
